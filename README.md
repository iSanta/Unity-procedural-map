# Description
This is an example of a procedural map system, it is generated with the Marching Cubes algorithm with a noise density map, each time it is a different map and you have the possibility to modify it with mouse clicks.

This project does not use compute shaders, all run on the CPU, so performance is not good, but it is a good example of how the marching cubes algorithm can be used for this proposal.
